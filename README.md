Maze-Game
=========

Bored in Physics one day, I started this fun little web project. A puzzle-like maze game. I work on this project occasionally whenever I am not on a more serious pursuit such as <a href="https://github.com/derekargueta/GroupSmart-iOS">Group Smart</a> or any work-related project. My goal is to turn this somewhat into a maze framework, supporting dynamic maze sizes, user-placed objects such as walls and portals, and whatnot.
The purpose of the game is to get from where you are (you being the blue box) and get to the end goal (the yellow box). Red boxes which kill you are spawned every three steps at random locations. You can use portals to travel across the map, and walls block movement. You can play the game <a href="http://www.dargueta.com/javascript_game/">Here</a>.
