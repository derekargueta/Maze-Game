Maze-Game
=========
Bored in Physics one day, I started this fun little web project. A puzzle-like 
maze game.
<br/><br/>
I work on this project occasionally whenever I am not on a 
more serious pursuit such as 
<a href="https://github.com/derekargueta/GroupSmart-iOS" target="_blank">Group Smart</a> or any 
work-related project. My goal is to turn this somewhat into a maze framework, 
supporting dynamic maze sizes, user-placed objects such as walls and portals, 
and whatnot.
<br/><br/>
The purpose of the game is to get from where you are (you 
being the blue box) and get to the end goal (the yellow box). Red boxes which 
kill you are spawned every three steps at random locations. You can use portals 
to travel across the map, and walls block movement.
<br/>
You can play the game <a href="http://www.dargueta.com/JS%20Game/" target="_blank">Here</a>.
